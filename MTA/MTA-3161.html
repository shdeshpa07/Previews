					A flaw was found in versions of the <code class="literal">webpack-dev-middleware</code> package before versions 7.1.0 and 6.1.2, in which it failed to validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning local files. This flaw allowed an attacker to craft URLs to return arbitrary local files from the developer’s machine. The lack of normalization before calling the middleware also allowed the attacker to perform path traversal attacks on the target environment.

					A flaw was discovered with the implementation of the <code class="literal">HTTP/2</code> protocol in the Go programming language. There were insufficient limitations on the number of CONTINUATION frames sent within a single stream. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

In versions before 1.20, the package was vulnerable to a Timing side-channel attack by observing the time it took for RSA-based Transport Layer Security (TLS) key exchanges, which was not constant.

				</p><pre class="programlisting language-terminal">&lt;Docker Root Dir&gt;=/usr/local/bin/docker mta-cli analyze</pre><p>

The root cause is that Java search patterns that use <code class="literal">IMPORT</code> as <code class="literal">location</code> and end in <code class="literal">.{*}</code>, do not function as expected. <a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2000">MTA-2000</a>
				</p></div><p>
				To resolve this issue, whenever a custom rule has a pattern ending in <code class="literal">.{*}</code> and location <code class="literal">IMPORT</code>, the pattern <code class="literal">.{*}</code> can be changed to <code class="literal">{*}</code> and the location changed to <code class="literal">PACKAGE</code>, as in the following example.

				The following highlighted issues have been resolved in Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) version 7.0.0.
			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>No update notification after editing fields</strong></p><p>
					In previous versions of MTA, no <code class="literal">Update Notification</code> appeared at top of window after the fields <code class="literal">Application</code>, <code class="literal">Job Function</code>, and <code class="literal">Business services</code> were updated. <a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-1024">MTA-1024</a>

				</p></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>CVE-2023-6291: A flaw was found in the <code class="literal">redirect_uri validation</code> logic</strong></p><p>
					A flaw was found in the <code class="literal">redirect_uri validation</code> logic that allows for a bypass of otherwise explicitly allowed hosts. The problem arises in the <code class="literal">verifyRedirectUri</code> method, which attempts to enforce rules on <code class="literal">user-controllable</code> input, but can cause a desynchronization in how Keycloak and browsers interpret URLs.

				The following are upgrade notes for Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA)
			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Hub database volume size</strong></p><p>
					In version 7.0.0 of MTA, the default size of the hub database volume has been increased to 10GiB.
				</p></div><p>
				If your storage class does not support volume expansion, then an upgrade from 6.2.1 to 7.0.0 will result in a failure due to the operator trying to change the volume size from 5GiB to 10GiB.
			</p><p>
				To avoid this issue, you can directly set the volume size by setting:
			</p><pre class="programlisting language-yaml">...
hub_database_volume_size: 5Gi
...</pre><p>
				By doing this, you will avoid the operator trying to resize the volume.
			</p><p>
				If this value was set when the previous version was deployed, there is no need to take any action, as it will work as expected.
			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Existing data</strong></p><p>
					When upgrading to MTA 7.0.0, all existing data will be retained, except for individual analysis reports for applications.
				</p></div><p>
				As both the analysis and reporting engines have been replaced with this version, you will be required to conduct a re-run of the analysis in order to obtain data on issues and dependencies.
			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Version upgrade</strong></p><p>
					You can upgrade to MTA 7.0.0 from 6.2.1. It is not recommended to pursue any alternative upgrade route. If you wish to upgrade from a previous version, it is recommended to proceed in a sequential manner until you finally upgrade from MTA version 6.2.1 to 7.0.0.
